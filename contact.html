            <h2>Something About Me and My Activities So Far</h2>
            <p>I'm currently learning and experiment with web development, electronics, video game development, and robotics! 
                My interests also include experimenting with Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Machine Learning!
            </p>
            <p>At the given moment, I'm currently experimenting all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript options that they have to offer
                by developing testing grounds to learn and experiment with some of their specific features. Progress is about 
                moving and learning forward one step at a time after all! Eventually, I will develop my first couple of significant 
                <bold>BIG</bold> projects in the form of the "Guess the Secret Number" game and my portfolio.
